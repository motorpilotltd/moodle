# Course Manager - READ ME

## Introduction
This plugin is the new Arup course manager which handles the management of courses that were previously part of the TAPS system.

## Phase 1
Migration of TAPS course/class adding/editing functionality to within Moodle to interact with existing local_taps_* tables.

## Phase 2
TBD
- Migration to new table structure.
- Migration of existing activities.
  - To course format... or to new activities.
  - mod/arupadvert, mod/arupenrol, mod/aruphonestybox, mod/tapscompletion, and mod/tapsenrol.

Notes from discussions:
- Class can have its own region.
- Show maximum attendees vs current attendees on class edit page.
- Snap theme-esque.
  - No left column.
  - Improved editing page (all editing in one place, as per example Bas demonstrated).
